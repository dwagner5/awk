awk..ward?

Lets take a look at this pengy boi

History

AWK was created at Bell Labs in the 1970s. Its name derives from the surnames of its authors — Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger, and Brian Kernighan. This is pronounced the same way as the bird, auk, which is coincidentally the glamour figure for the programming language.

Purpose

AWK was designed for text processing and is generally used for data extraction and reporting. It is standard in almost all UNIX-like operating systems. Because of this, my research was conducted on Mac OS X.  AWK is data driven, and utilizes a set of actions to be used against streams of text-based data, generally to produce reports. Because of this, AWK utilizes the string data type extensively, as well as regex (regular expressions). Alfred Aho, one of AWK’s creators, explains, “an AWK program is a sequence of pattern-action statements… a line is scanner for a pattern… and for each pattern that matches, the associated action is executed”. Pretty nifty.



Learning Materials

Shamelessly, Wikipedia is a great resource for learning the historical background of the language as well as some contextual information. Therefore, I have included this in my list of sources. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK

GNU’s documentation on the language is also very good, and details the features of the language. https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html
I’ve also purchased a copy of O’Reilly’s Effective awk Programming, 4th Edition. I’ve always enjoyed O’Reilly’s book series so I think this will be a great tool to use as a reference.
